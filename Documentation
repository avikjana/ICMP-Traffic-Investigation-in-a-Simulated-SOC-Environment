# SOC Network Traffic Analysis – ICMP Monitoring Lab
Document Type:** Technical Lab Report (ISO-style)
Prepared By:- Avik Jana
Date:12.01.2026
1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to record the setup, execution, observation, and analysis of ICMP network traffic in a controlled laboratory environment. This activity was conducted to establish baseline network behavior and to understand how ICMP traffic is captured, analyzed, and documented from a SOC (Security Operations Center) perspective.
2. Scope
This document covers:
Lab environment configuration
ICMP traffic generation
Packet capture methodology
Traffic analysis using Wireshark
Observations and conclusions
The scope is limited to internal lab traffic and does not include real-world production systems
 3. Definitions and Abbreviations
* SOC: Security Operations Center
* ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol
* PCAP: Packet Capture File
* VM: Virtual Machine
## 4. Lab Environment
### 4.1 Host System
* Platform: Single Physical PC
* Virtualization Software: Oracle VirtualBox
### 4.2 Virtual Machines
| Role                     | Operating System | IP Address     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------- |
| SOC Analyst / Monitoring | Kali Linux       | 192.168.56.101 |
| Internal Host (Victim)   | Ubuntu Linux     | 192.168.56.102 |
### 4.3 Network Configuration
* Network Type: Host-only Adapter
* Subnet: 192.168.56.0/24
* DHCP: Enabled
This configuration ensures full visibility of east-west traffic between virtual machines.
## 5. Tools and Utilities
* tcpdump – Used for live packet capture and evidence collection
* Wireshark – Used for packet-level inspection and analysis
* ping – Used to generate ICMP traffic
## 6. Methodology
 6.1 Traffic Generation
ICMP traffic was generated from the Ubuntu virtual machine using the `ping` utility targeting the Kali Linux machine. This simulates standard network reachability testing performed by users or administrators.
### 6.2 Packet Capture
Packet capture was initiated on the Kali Linux machine using the following command:
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w soc_icmp_lab.pcap
The capture was allowed to run while ICMP traffic was active. After sufficient packets were collected, the capture process was manually terminated.
### 6.3 Evidence Handling
Captured traffic was stored in PCAP format for offline analysis. No packets were dropped during capture
## 7. Analysis
### 7.1 Tool Used
Wireshark was used to open and analyze the captured PCAP file.
### 7.2 Observations
* Multiple ICMP Echo Request packets were observed from 192.168.56.102 to 192.168.56.101
* Corresponding ICMP Echo Reply packets were observed in response
* Sequence numbers increased sequentially
* Packet intervals were consistent
* No malformed packets or payload anomalies were detected
### 7.3 Traffic Classification
Based on frequency, pattern, and context, the ICMP traffic was classified as **normal diagnostic activity**.
## 8. SOC Assessment
From a SOC analyst perspective:
* The traffic matches expected baseline ICMP behavior
* No indicators of scanning, flooding, or denial-of-service attempts were identified
* No alert escalation was required
## 9. Conclusion
This lab successfully demonstrated the process of capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic in a controlled SOC-style environment. Establishing a baseline understanding of normal ICMP behavior is essential for differentiating between legitimate network diagnostics and malicious reconnaissance or flood attacks.
## 10. Learning Outcomes
* Practical experience with packet capture using tcpdump
* Hands-on analysis of ICMP protocol behavior
* Understanding of SOC-style evidence handling and documentation
* Improved confidence in network traffic investigation
## 11. Future Enhancements
* Simulation of ICMP flood activity for anomaly comparison
* Integration with SIEM tools for alert generation
* Extension to DNS and TCP-based traffic analysis
